# Project NoteKeeper Given by: Be Zen
This is an application, where users can write and keep their notes. 


# Functionalities to be implemented - 

Allows user to add a note with a title, tagline and body. The note is visible in a grid layout on page and clicking on one will open up editable content in a pop-up on the screen.

Also, the notes can be pinned such that regardless of date of origin or last edit, pinned notes are always at the top. Pagination has been implemented. One page can contain at max 6 notes, no more.

# Running the Project

## `yarn install`

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

## `yarn build`

It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!
